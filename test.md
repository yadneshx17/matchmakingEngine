# ⚙️ Real-Time Matchmaking Engine (MVP)

This is an **MVP** of a **real-time matchmaking engine** built with **FastAPI + Redis + Socket.IO**.  
It handles **player queueing, matchmaking, notifications, and pub/sub events** — all working **end-to-end** so clients get **instant match notifications** when a match is found.
